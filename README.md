Stalwart Keypad Safe Cracking Robot
This is the 3D model of the safe. The following repository includes a .3dm (editable rhino file), and interactive stl (untextured but 
allows the user to rotate it and look at it), and JPEG images of the model with textures applied using Fusion 360.

Why are we doing this?
For our class, this modeling is necessary to aid our group in thinking in terms of the dimensions of the safe for building a robot 
for it.
